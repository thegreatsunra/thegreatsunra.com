      <a href="https://www.geaviation.com/" rel="external">GE Aviation</a>, Cincinnati, OH (remote from Minneapolis, MN)<br>
      April 2018 – October 2019
    </p>
    <p>Worked with the GE Aviation Fleet Support team to strategize, design and build Fleet Monitor X, a diagnostics suite that consolidates twenty separate tools for monitoring a global fleet of more than 24,000 aircraft and 56,000 engines.</p>
    <p>Built complex, responsive prototypes in Vue.js and Vuetify, populated by large sets of realistic data generated with Node.js. Prototypes were rapidly integrated into application code and fed real data from back-end services.</p>

    <p class="c-resume__metadata">
      <a href="https://filament.com/" rel="external">Filament</a>, Reno, NV (remote from Minneapolis, MN)<br>
      January 2017 – March 2018
    </p>
    <p>Filament builds edge hardware for the industrial internet that allows assets to wirelessly and securely talk to each other. As Filament’s design technologist I built cross-platform apps for managing hardware, “headless” apps for connecting to mesh networks, and cloud infrastructures for securely transmitting and storing asset data.</p>
    <p>Using AWS and Terraform, I built a <a href="/portfolio/filament-infrastructure">scalable cloud infrastructure</a> that securely connects to a Filament mesh network and receives, stores, and publishes device data for authorized agents. Components included AWS IoT for connecting to Filament gateway devices, Lambda for processing device reports and API requests, Cognito for securing API access and authorizing users, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and S3 for hosting a web app secured with Cognito and written in Vue.js and Mapbox.</p>
    <p>Using Node.js, I wrote a gateway script that connects to a Filament mesh network and sends device reports to any configured integration, including AWS IoT, Microsoft SQL Server, Losant, and Socket.io. I packaged the script to function in numerous contexts, including on a Raspberry Pi, inside a Docker container, deployed remotely via BalenaCloud (née Resin.io), and embedded in a desktop app.</p>
    <p>I built a mobile progressive web app, secured by AWS Cognito and populated with data from API Gateway, that allows users to quickly activate a new Filament device. Capabilities included scanning a QR code on a device, confirming Filament mesh network connectivity, visualizing the status of the mesh network and all known devices, and displaying devices on a map.</p>
